**Summary**

--It is very important for a car dealer to have the ability to predict the price a used car can fetch in order to make a profitable investment. The aim of our work is to develop a machine-learning model that can predict the price of a used car by using its attributes as variables. For that purpose, we use a dataset found in kaggle created by web scraping containing over 200,000 car offers from one of the largest car advertisement sites in Poland. We select the attributes we need as variables, and after pre-processing data we use PCA, k-means clustering, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest regression to create a model that estimates the price of a used car in order to assist the car seller to cost the car. Finally, we evaluate our model by predicting the prices of a sample of 100 from our data and estimating the percentage error for each prediction.  --
